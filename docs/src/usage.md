# Usage
On this page, we demonstrate common patterns for expressing influence diagrams and creating decision models using `DecisionProgramming.jl`. We also discuss the abstraction that is created using the influence diagram structure. We can import the package with the `using` keyword.

```julia
using DecisionProgramming
```


## Adding nodes
![](figures/2chance_1decision_1value.svg)

Given the above influence diagram, we express it as a Decision Programming model as follows. We create `ChanceNode` and `DecisionNode` instances and add them to the influence diagram. Creating a `ChanceNode` or `DecisionNode` requires giving it a unique name, its information set and its states. If the node is a root node, the information set is left empty using square brackets. The order in which nodes are added does not matter.

```julia
diagram = InfluenceDiagram()
add_node!(diagram, DecisionNode("D1", [], ["a", "b"]))
add_node!(diagram, ChanceNode("C2", ["D1", "C1"], ["v", "w"]))
add_node!(diagram, ChanceNode("C1", [], ["x", "y", "z"]))
```

Value nodes are added by simply giving it a name and its information set. Value nodes do not have states because their purpose is to map their information state to utility values.

```julia
add_node!(diagram, ValueNode("V", ["C2"]))
```

Once all the nodes are added, we generate the arcs. This orders the nodes and numbers them such that each node's predecessors have smaller numbers than the node itself. In effect, the chance and decision nodes are numbered such that $C \cup D = \{1,...,n\}$, where $n = \mid C\mid + \mid D\mid$. The value nodes are numbered $V = \{n+1,..., N\}$, where $N = \mid C\mid + \mid D\mid + \mid V \mid$. For more details on influence diagrams see page [influence diagram](decision-programming/influence-diagram.md).
```julia
generate_arcs!(diagram)
```
Now the fields `Nodes`, `Names`, `I_j`, `States`, `S`, `C`, `D` and `V` in the influence diagram structure have been properly filled. The `Nodes` field holds all node information (name, index, type, information set and states). The `Names` field holds the names of all nodes. Field `I_j` holds the information sets of each node. Field `States` holds the names of the states of each node and field `S` holds the number of states each node has. Fields `C`, `D` and `V` contain the chance, decision and value nodes respectively. In all fields other than `Names`, the information is stored in OrderedDict with node name as key.

## Probability Matrices
Each chance node needs a probability matrix which describes the probability distribution over its states given an information state. It holds probability values
$$ℙ(X_j=s_j∣X_{I(j)}=𝐬_{I(j)})$$

for all $s_j \in S_j$ and $𝐬_{I(j)} \in 𝐒_{I(j)}$.

Thus, the probability matrix of a chance node needs to have dimensions that correspond to the number of states of the nodes in its information set and number of state of the node itself.

For example, the node C1 in the influence diagram above has an empty information set and three states $x, y$, and $z$. Therefore its probability matrix needs dimensions (3,1). If the probabilities of events $x, y$, and $z$ occuring are $10\%, 30\%$ and $60\%$, then the probability matrix $X_{C1}$ should be $[0.1 \quad 0.3 \quad 0.6]$. The order of the probability values is determined by the order in which the states are given when the node is added. The states are also stored in this order in the `States` vector.

In Decision Programming the probability matrix of node C1 can be added in the following way. Note, that probability matrices can only be added after the arcs have been generated.

```julia
# How C1 was added: add_node!(diagram, ChanceNode("C1", [], ["x", "y", "z"]))
X_C1 = [0.1, 0.3, 0.6]
add_probabilities!(diagram, "C1", X_C1)
```

The `add_probabilities!` function adds the probability matrix as a `Probabilities` structure into the influence diagram's `X` field.
```julia
julia> diagram.X
OrderedCollections.OrderedDict{String, Probabilities} with 1 entry:
  "C1" => [0.1, 0.3, 0.6]
```


As another example, we will add the probability matrix of node C2. It has two nodes in its information set: C1 and D1. These nodes have 3 and 2 states, respectively. Node C2 itself has 2 states. Now, the question is: should the dimensions of the probability matrix be $(|S_{C1}|, |\ S_{D1}|, |\ S_{C2}|) = (3, 2, 2)$ or $(|S_{D1}|, |\ S_{C1}|, \ |S_{C2}|) = (2, 3, 2)$? The answer is that the dimensions should be in ascending order of the nodes' indices that they correspond to. This is also the order that the information set is in in the field `I_j`. In this case the influence diagram looks like this:
```julia
julia> diagram.Names
4-element Vector{String}:
 "D1"
 "C2"
 "C1"
 "V"

julia> diagram.I_j
OrderedCollections.OrderedDict{String, Vector{String}} with 4 entries:
  "D1" => []
  "C2" => ["D1", "C1"]
  "C1" => []
  "V"  => ["C2"]

julia> diagram.S
OrderedCollections.OrderedDict{String, Int16} with 3 entries:
  "D1" => 2
  "C2" => 2
  "C1" => 3
```

Therefore, the probability matrix of node C2 should have dimensions $(|S_{D1}|, |\ S_{C1}|, \ |S_{C2}|) = (2, 3, 2)$. The probability matrix can be added by declaring the matrix and then filling in the probability values as shown below.
```julia
X_C2 = zeros(2, 3, 2)
X_C2[1, 1, 1] = ...
X_C2[1, 1, 2] = ...
X_C2[1, 1, 2] = ...
⋮
add_probabilities!(diagram, "C2", X_C2)
```
In order to be able to fill in the probability values, it is crucial to understand what the matrix indices represent. The indices represent a subpath in the influence diagram. The states in the path are referred to with their numbers instead of with their names. The states of a node are numbered according to their positions in the vector of states in field `States`. The order of the states of each node is seen below. From this, we can deduce that for nodes D1, C1, C2 the subpath `(1,1,1)` corresponds to subpath $(a, x, v)$ and subpath `(1, 3, 2)` corresponds to subpath $(a, z, w)$. Therefore, the probability value at `X_C2[1, 3, 2]` should be the probability of the scenario $(a, z, w)$ occuring.
```julia
julia> diagram.States
OrderedCollections.OrderedDict{String, Vector{String}} with 3 entries:
  "D1" => ["a", "b"]
  "C2" => ["v", "w"]
  "C1" => ["x", "y", "z"]
```
### Helper Syntax
Figuring out the dimensions of a probability matrix and adding the probability values is difficult. Therefore, we have implemented an easier syntax.

A probability matrix can be initialised with the correct dimensions using the `ProbabilityMatrix` function. It initiliases the probability matrix with zeros.
```julia
julia> X_C2 = ProbabilityMatrix(diagram, "C2")
2×3×2 ProbabilityMatrix{3}:
[:, :, 1] =
 0.0  0.0  0.0
 0.0  0.0  0.0

[:, :, 2] =
 0.0  0.0  0.0
 0.0  0.0  0.0

julia> size(X_C2)
(2, 3, 2)
```
A matrix of type `ProbabilityMatrix` can be filled using the names of the states. The states must however be given in the correct order, according to the order of the nodes in the information set vector `I_j`. Notice that if we use the `Colon` (`:`) to indicate several elements of the matrix, the probability values have to be given in the correct order of the states in `States`.
```julia
julia> X_C2["a", "z", "w"] = 0.25
0.25

julia> X_C2["z", "a", "v"] = 0.75
ERROR: DomainError with Node D1 does not have a state called z.:

julia> X_C2["a", "z", "v"] = 0.75
0.75

julia> X_C2["a", "x", :] = [0.3, 0.7]
2-element Array{Float64,1}:
 0.3
 0.7
```

A matrix of type `ProbabilityMatrix` can also be filled using the matrix indices if that is more convient. The following achieves the same as what was done above.
```julia
julia> X_C2[1, 3, 2] = 0.25
0.25

julia> X_C2[1, 3, 1] = 0.75
0.75

julia> X_C2[1, 1, :] = [0.3, 0.7]
2-element Array{Float64,1}:
 0.3
 0.7
```

Now, the probability matrix X_C2 is partially filled.
```julia
julia> X_C2
2×3×2 ProbabilityMatrix{3}:
[:, :, 1] =
 0.3  0.0  0.75
 0.0  0.0  0.0

[:, :, 2] =
 0.7  0.0  0.25
 0.0  0.0  0.0
```

The probability matrix can be added to the influence diagram once it has been filled with probability values. The probability matrix of node C2 is added exactly like before, despite X_C2 now being a matrix of type `ProbabilityMatrix`.
```julia
julia> add_probabilities!(diagram, "C2", X_C2)
```

## Utility Matrices
Each value node maps its information states to utility values. In Decision Programming the utility values are passed to the influence diagram using utility matrices. Utility matrices are very similar to probability matrices of chance nodes. There are only two important differences. First, the utility matrices hold utility values instead of probabilities, meaning that they do not need to sum to one. Second, since value nodes do not have states, the cardinality of a utility matrix depends only on the number of states of the nodes in the information set.

As an example, the utility matrix of node V should have dimensions (2,1) because its information set consists of node C2, which has two states. If state $v$ of node C2 yields a utility of -100 and state $w$ yields utility of 400, then the utility matrix of node V can be added in the following way. Note, that utility matrices can only be added after the arcs have been generated.

```julia
julia> Y_V = zeros(2)
2-element Array{Float64,1}:
 0.0
 0.0

julia> Y_V[1] = -100
-100

julia> Y_V[2] = 400
400

julia> add_utilities!(diagram, "V", Y_V)
```


The other option is to add the utility matrix using the `UtilityMatrix` type. This is very similar to the `ProbabilityMatrix` type. The `UtilityMatrix` function initialises the values to `Inf`. Using the `UtilityMatrix` type's functionalities, the utility matrix of node V could also be added like shown below. This achieves the exact same result as we did above with the more abstract syntax.


```julia
julia> Y_V = UtilityMatrix(diagram, "V")
2-element UtilityMatrix{1}:
 Inf
 Inf

julia> Y_V["w"] = 400
400

julia> Y_V["v"] = -100
-100

julia> add_utilities!(diagram, "V", Y_V)
```

The `add_utilities!` function adds the utility matrix as a `Utilities` structure into the influence diagram's `Y` field.
```julia
julia> diagram.Y
1-element Array{Utilities,1}:
 [-100.0, 400.0]
```

## Generating and solving the model

The final part is generating and solving the model. Generating the model is done using the `generate_model` function.
```julia
model, z, variables = generate_model(diagram, model_type="RJT")
```
The execution of `generate_model` can be divided into six parts:

1. Diagram generation using `generate_diagram!`. This part generates the influence diagram. Probability and utility matrices are sorted in fields `X` and `Y` according to diagram.Names. Path probability and path utility types are initialized and added into fields `P` and `U`, respectively. By default `generate_model` and `generate_diagram!` use the default path probabilities and utilities, which are defined as the joint probability of all chance events in the diagram and the sum of utilities in value nodes, respectively.

2. Initializing JuMP Model. 

3. Initializing and adding decision variables.

4. Initializing and adding either the RJT variables the path compatibility variables. This part generates either RJT variables (model_type="RJT") or path compatibility variables (model_type="DP") based on the model type chosen.

5. Expected value function creation. 

5. Objective function creation. Expected value function is set as the objective and set to be maximized in the model.

`generate_model` has an optional argument *names*, which will name variables according to node names with state indices if set as true and just as simple indices if set as false. The latter might bring some performance improvements for very large models. The default value is true, which is generally preferable due to more clear naming of variables. 

Practical examples of creating influence diagrams and solving them using `generate_model` are given in examples. More information on both [RJT](decision-programming/RJT-model.md) and [DP models](decision-programming/path-based-model.md) are in Decision Programming section.
